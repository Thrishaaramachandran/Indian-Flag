# Indian-Flag

This project illustrates the Indian national flag, or the Tiranga (meaning "tricolor"), symbolizing India's values and ideals.

Flag Structure and Significance:
Three Horizontal Stripes:

Saffron Stripe (Top): This stripe, in a deep saffron color, symbolizes courage, sacrifice, and the strength of the Indian people.
White Stripe (Middle): The middle stripe represents peace, truth, and honesty, and serves as the backdrop for the Ashoka Chakra.
Green Stripe (Bottom): The green color in the bottom stripe stands for growth, fertility, and the prosperous lands of India.

Ashoka Chakra:

Centered on the white stripe, the Ashoka Chakra is a navy-blue wheel with 24 spokes. This wheel is derived from the Lion Capital of Ashoka and reflects the ideals of justice, continuity, and movement.
Each of the 24 spokes represents principles like courage, patience, justice, welfare, and more, collectively symbolizing the dynamism and eternal progress of the nation.

Message:

A patriotic phrase, "VANDE MATARAM" ("I bow to thee, Mother"), is displayed at the bottom, representing respect and devotion to the nation. This phrase echoes the spirit of India's independence movement and pays homage to the motherland.

Summary of Purpose:

My flag project celebrates India's unity in diversity, its rich history, and the guiding principles of its people. The tricolor and Chakra together reflect a vision of progress, peace, and patriotism, reminding citizens of their duty toward the nation's growth and harmony.
